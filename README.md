# SnapFit

## Goal
SnapFit is a fitness app project created by the passion to make an application we can be proud to
demonstrate. Something unique that will be able to help people by making a positive impact on
the lives of individuals. In today's busy world, maintaining a consistent fitness regimen can be
challenging. This is why we want to create an application that will help people stay active
without complicating how to stay in shape.

## Quick-start
Open the project on Android Studio
download the Google service file found on the GitHub root level
install the Google service file and install it at the following path /app/src/main/java/com/example/SnapFit/
to avoid any errors, it is recommended to also add the file to 5A6-group-project/app/src/main/debug/
Once the file is installed press on the green arrow to start the application
If you are using the application for the first time select SignUp
